## Android App and Python Server
To run the Android app, I cloned this project: https://github.com/simondlevy/AndroidBluetoothClient/blob/master/BluetoothClient/app/src/main/java/levy/cs/wlu/edu/bluetoothclient/MyCommunicationsActivity.java 

In that project, I changed/added 3 java files in app/src/main/java/. Add/replace the java files in this repo that that directory. I also modified app/src/main/res/layout/activity_communications.xml. Replace that xml file with the xml file in this repo. 

To run the python script, download both python scripts and run.
